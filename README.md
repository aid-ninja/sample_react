### Sample React Project 

The sample application has been bootstrapped using Vite and its react-ts template. It allows us to create applications quickly without dealing with a complex tooling setup such as bundling, transpiling etc. Another reason for using Vite is simplicity, as it doesn't force us to use the meta-framework specific things, and allows us to focus on React.
